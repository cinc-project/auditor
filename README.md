# outspec experiment

With the recent announcement that Chef is opensourcing all it's software the community has started this effort to create a distribution that's built in collaboration with Chef and in compliance with the Chef Trademarks Policy.
This repo contains the initial proof of concept for modifying the name of the binaries associated with Chef to achieve compliance.

Guidelines TBD, come see us on Chef's Community Slack in #community-distros to talk about how you can help!
